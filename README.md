# What is it?
## This project allows the user to encrypt or decrypt a plaintext/string utilizing DES and AES as private key schemes, and RSA for a public key scheme.

# How to use
## The user simply selects what type of encryption algorithm they would like to use on the right side of the "Supported Encryptions" tab. Once selected the user can enter their plaintext or string that they would like to encrypt in the encrypt box, from there select which mode of operations you would like to use, as well as a key. Click the encrypt button and the output should display on the decrypt box, in order to decrypt, place the encrypted output in the decrypt box and click decrypt and it should display on the encrypt box.
